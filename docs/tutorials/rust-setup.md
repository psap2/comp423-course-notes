Hey! This tutorial will walk you through how to set up a dev container for Rust. This tutorial will create a Rust Development Container in VS Code to make cohesive development enviorments.

## Prerequisites
1. A GitHub account: If you don’t have one yet, create one at [GitHub](https://github.com).
1. Git installed: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com) if you don’t have one already.
1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Download from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com).
1. Docker installed: Required to run the dev container. [Get Docker here](https://www.docker.com).

## Part 1: Project Setup: Creating a Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt
1. Create a new directory for the project. (Note: Of course, if you'd like to organize this tutorial somewhere else on your machine, go ahead and change into that parent directory first. By default this will be in your user's home directory.) # Setting up a dev container for Rust
